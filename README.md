# sparkStreaming
Spark Streaming demo in Scala


This code was used for initial learning of Spark, Spark Streaming, and Scala.  The file names typically 
tell what is inside.  For example Accumulators.scala shows how Spark accumulators work and AuxContructor.scala
shows how constructors work in Scala.

TweetProcessor.scala is the Spark Streaming Scala code.
